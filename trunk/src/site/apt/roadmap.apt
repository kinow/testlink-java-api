Roadmap

 TestLink Java API is an API that is always accompanying TestLink XML-RPC API. 
 It means that when TestLink releases a new version we are already working on 
 a new version that is 100% compatible with TestLink's new version. 
 It also means that if you want to use TestLink Java API with TestLink 1.9, you have 
 to use TestLink Java API version 1.9.

* version 2.0
 
 * Keep 100% compatibility with TestLink XML-RPC API
 
 * Increase overall test coverage above 75%
 
 * Remove warnings during Javadoc generation
