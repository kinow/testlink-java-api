In the beginning we were using FTP to update the site. 

Now we are using a maven plug-in that compresses the site folder, uploads it 
to the web server and updates the site much faster. 

    Create a shell on shell.sourceforge.net with your username and project group

    ssh -t <username>,<project name>@shell.sf.net create

    Use shell.sourceforge.net (instead of web.sourceforge.net) in you site URL

      ...
      <distributionManagement>
        ...
        <site>
          <id>your_project.sf.net</id>
          <url>scp://shell.sourceforge.net/home/groups/y/yo/your_project/htdocs</url>
        </site>
      </distributionManagement>

    Run mvn site:deploy
    Verify that you have a working web site by opening a browser to http://your_project.sf.net
