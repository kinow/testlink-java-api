TestLink Java API

 TestLink Java API is a Java API that interfaces TestLink XML-RPC API. 
 This API lets you call TestLink internal methods such as createTestProject, 
 uploadAttachment, getTestProjectByName among others.

 Our aim with this project is always release one version of this API after a new 
 version of TestLink has been released. So if, for instance, TestLink releases 
 version 2.0, we will release testlink-java-api-2.0. 
 
 One fact to keep in mind is that TestLink Java API can't assure you Backward 
 Compabitility among its versions. It occurs because TestLink XML-RPC API is 
 constantly changing. Even some methods are renamed. So trying to keep 
 Backward Compatibility would be really cumbersome. 
 
 Another important thing is that behind the scenes we are using xml-rpc to 
 communicate with TestLink. However you won't see any xml or even a Map/HashMap 
 when using TestLink Java API (ok, maybe in only one method :-).
 
 If you call the method getTestPlanPlatforms it will return an array of 
 Platform (an object in TestLink Java API). This way you won't need handle 
 Maps :-) And in case of any error, the message will come to you in a nice 
 TestLinkAPIException. This is the basic concepts to get the gist of the 
 TestLink Java API.
