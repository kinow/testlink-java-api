Release Notes

* Version 1.9.2-2

 * Added support to Execution Order in Test Cases

* Version 1.9.2-1

 * Simplified the Services. Before it was creating one XML-RPC API for each  
 service. Now it creates only one for the API. 
 
 * Instead of creating an API with two Strings (one for the URL and other for 
 the devKey) now you create the API with a java.net.URL and a String. It removed 
 the need to catch the MalformedURLException during construction of the API.

* Version 1.9.2-0

 * Compatibility version for TestLink 1.9.2
 
 * Added generic method to call XML-RPC API directly
 
 * Fixed minor BUG with Test Case Mapping and execution status from Builds (found out during tests)
 
 * Added java.util.logging and custom RPC transport with logging enabled.
